Coding Agent Prompt Index and Workflow

_Single source of truth for all implementation prompts._
_Last updated: 2026-04-04 — Phase D complete (v7.6.0.5); Critical Rules 43–46 confirmed; Phase D results and summary produced_
_Replaces: `phase3-prompt-templates.md`, `phase3-prompt-templates-updated.md`, `prompt-update-summary.md`_

## How This Works

Each implementation step has a self-contained prompt file that a coding agent can execute from scratch. The prompt contains everything the agent needs: context, required reading, exact scope, critical rules, acceptance criteria, and device testing instructions.

Your job as the human operator is to:

1. Pick the next step from the Step Index below
2. Copy the prompt into a new conversation with the coding agent
3. Supervise the PR, merge, device-test, and tag
4. Record results and move to the next step

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Before starting a step

1. Confirm the previous step is merged to `main` and tagged
2. If the previous step required device testing, confirm results are recorded
3. Verify `main` is green: `bash scripts/preflight.sh` and Playwright pass
4. Check the Step Index below for the next step and its prompt file location

### Giving the prompt to the coding agent

Open a **new conversation** with the coding agent (do not continue a previous conversation — each step starts fresh). Paste this:

```
Clone 

Before making ANY changes, read the implementation instructions file completely:
prompts/<phase>/<version>-implementation-instructions-for-coding-agent.md

Then read every file listed in the "Required Reading" section of that document.

Then implement the step exactly as specified.

Current status:
- Previous step v<PREV_VERSION> is complete and merged
- Device testing results from previous step: <PASTE RESULTS OR "confirmed passing">
- main is green, all Playwright tests pass
- Current date: <TODAY>

Follow all rules listed under "Critical Rules" in the instructions file.
After implementation, run validation (preflight + Playwright), create a PR,
and provide the exact device testing checklist for me to execute post-merge.

MANDATORY deliverables (in addition to the code):
- Session log: Docs/session-log-<TODAY>-<VERSION>.md
- Instruction Compliance Output table in the PR description
- Validation Evidence (exact command + pass/fail/skip counts)

Do NOT proceed to any later step.
```

Fill in:
- `<phase>` — `phase4`, `phase5`, `phase6`, `phaseD`, or `phase7`
- `<version>` — e.g., `v7.7.0.0`
- `<PREV_VERSION>` — the version that was just completed
- `<TODAY>` — current date
- Device testing results — paste the actual curl outputs / heap values / screenshots from the previous step

### While the agent works

The agent will:
1. Clone the repo
2. Read the instructions and required files
3. Implement the changes
4. Run preflight and Playwright tests
5. Create a session log
6. Provide an Instruction Compliance Output table
7. Create a PR
8. Provide a device testing checklist

### After the agent completes

1. **Verify the session log exists** — `Docs/session-log-<DATE>-<VERSION>.md`
2. **Verify the Instruction Compliance Output** — every prompt requirement mapped to code
3. **Review the PR diff** — look for anything that contradicts the instructions
4. **Approve pending CI workflows** if needed (first-time contributors may need approval)
5. **Wait for all CI checks to pass** — do not merge on red
6. **If any workflow fails:** copy the exact failure output, send it back to the agent in the same conversation, and wait for the fix
7. **Merge only if all checks are green**
8. **Execute the device testing checklist** the agent provided (if applicable)
9. **Apply the git tag:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a v<VERSION> -m "<description from instructions file>"
   git push origin v<VERSION>
   ```
10. **Record results** — save heap values, screenshots, curl outputs. These become the "device testing results" you paste into the next step's prompt.

## Critical Rules (Apply to Every Step)

These come from bugs and lessons learned and are baked into every prompt. They are listed here for reference — you do not need to add them to the prompt text; they are already in each prompt file.

| # | Rule | Source |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Use `::time(nullptr)` not `time(nullptr)` in ESPHome C++ | Project convention |
| 2 | Use `bash scripts/bump-version.sh <version>` for every version bump | All steps |
| 3 | Regenerate all artifacts after source changes | All steps |
| 4 | Run `bash scripts/preflight.sh` — must pass | All steps |
| 5 | Run full Playwright suite with CI-exact `FIXTURE_SET=` commands — bare `npx playwright test` is NOT sufficient | All steps (revised 2026-03-21) |
| 6 | Mirror all `dashboard.js` changes to `dashboard.html` | LESSON-OPS-043 |
| 7 | Never fire concurrent history requests from dashboard JS | LESSON-OPS-052 |
| 8 | Never use `beginResponseStream` for responses >10KB | LESSON-OPS-056 |
| 9 | Dashboard.h must be gzip-compressed | LESSON-OPS-055 |
| 10 | In-flight guards mandatory on interval-driven fetch functions | LESSON-OPS-050 |
| 11 | NVS scan loops must yield (`vTaskDelay` every N blobs) | LESSON-OPS-053 |
| 12 | `NUM_SENSORS` must alias `NUM_ENV_SENSORS`, never `NUM_DEVICES` | BUG-045 |
| 13 | Device testing sections must include full pull/compile/flash/verify workflow | LESSON-OPS-058 |
| 14 | Specified tests/checks must be tracked to implementation completion | LESSON-OPS-057 |
| 15 | Adding a new device category requires an endpoint audit of ALL existing endpoints | LESSON-OPS-064 |
| 16 | Native browser widgets need `color-scheme` CSS property for dark/light mode | LESSON-OPS-065 |
| 17 | Build pipeline intermediate artifacts must be re-derived on version bumps | LESSON-OPS-066 |
| 18 | Adding a new fixture variant requires a MANDATORY full-suite audit under that variant | BUG-051 / LESSON-OPS-063 |
| 19 | Expanding a shared array (SENSORS) requires auditing ALL index-based consumers | BUG-056 |
| 20 | Every step must produce a session log as a MANDATORY deliverable | Phase 4 review finding |
| 21 | Every step must produce an Instruction Compliance Output table in the PR | Phase 4 review finding |
| 22 | All partition tables must have `ota_0` at `0x10000` — verify before flashing | LESSON-OPS-070 / BUG-061 |
| 23 | Module-level imports for optional deps (e.g. `yaml`) must be lazy (inside the function that needs them) | LESSON-OPS-071 / BUG-060 |
| 24 | `esp_get_free_heap_size()` includes PSRAM — report both internal and total heap separately | LESSON-OPS-072 / BUG-062 |
| 25 | LXC USB passthrough loses permissions on device reconnect — use udev rules or flash from host | LESSON-OPS-073 |
| 26 | Aggregator boot must be a superset of satellite boot, never a fork — unified pipeline + overlay | LESSON-OPS-074 / BUG-064 |
| 27 | ESPHome IDF socket calls must use `lwip_*` prefixed functions, not BSD socket aliases | LESSON-OPS-068 / BUG-057 |
| 28 | Version bumps require BOTH `render_sensor_config.py --write` AND `node tests/fixtures/generate-fixtures.js`, then verify with `--check` and `grep free_heap tests/fixtures/api-status.json` | LESSON-OPS-077 / BUG-062 |
| 29 | Prompt-provided code blocks must be reviewed as production code before prompt publication | LESSON-OPS-084 / Phase 6 audit |
| 30 | Mock endpoints must mirror all firmware validation branches — stub-level mocking prohibited | LESSON-OPS-081 |
| 31 | Fixture composition changes require downstream text audit (skip reasons, comments, helpers) | LESSON-OPS-082 |
| 32 | Playwright test signatures must only destructure used fixtures | LESSON-OPS-083 |
| 33 | Unsupported-platform stub functions must return the documented safe default (usually `0.0`) | Phase 6.3 audit finding |
| 34 | Shell scripts with locale-sensitive commands must use `LC_ALL=C` | Phase 6.3 audit finding |
| 35 | Python network/file resources must use context managers (`with`) in long-running modes | Phase 6.3 audit finding |
| 36 | Device testing firmware commands must reference the GENERATED YAML for the target board — never use the committed C3 template (`esp32-c3-multi-sensor.yaml`) for non-C3 boards. Generated YAMLs are gitignored and only exist after `render_sensor_config.py --write`. | LESSON-OPS-090 |
| 37 | Regeneration pipeline must include `minify-dashboard.sh` before `generate-header.sh`. Full pipeline: `render_sensor_config.py --write` → `generate-fixtures.js` → `minify-dashboard.sh` → `generate-header.sh` → `render_sensor_config.py --check` | LESSON-OPS-091 |
| 38 | All dashboard `fetch()` POST calls must use `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with `body: \'a=1\'`. ESPHome does not consume JSON POST bodies. | BUG-076 / LESSON-OPS-099 |
| 39 | All `curl` POST commands must use `-d \'a=1\'`. Never use `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`, never use `-d \'\'`, never use bare `-X POST` without a body. | BUG-076 / LESSON-OPS-099 |
| 40 | Any HTTP handler performing NVS operations must use the deferred task pattern (`xTaskCreate`, 8192+ byte stack). Never perform NVS work synchronously in an HTTP handler. | BUG-075 / LESSON-OPS-100/101 |
| 41 | Never add `CONFIG_HTTPD_STACK_SIZE` to any board profile `sdkconfig_options` in `firmware/boards/*.yaml` or in generated board YAMLs. It has zero runtime effect — ESPHome hardcodes the httpd task stack at 4 KB and ignores this setting. The legacy `firmware/esp32-c3-multi-sensor.yaml` template is exempt from this rule. | BUG-075 / LESSON-OPS-100 |
| 42 | All board profiles must include an `external_components` block referencing `firmware/local_components` for the patched `web_server_idf` component. Without this, the httpd task runs at 4 KB and all POST handlers crash. Run `scripts/patch-esphome-httpd-stack.sh --check` to verify. | BUG-075 / LESSON-OPS-102 |
| 43 | After re-running `scripts/patch-esphome-httpd-stack.sh` (ESPHome upgrade), verify that `init_response_()` in the local component still contains the expanded HTTP status code switch with `snprintf` fallback. The patch script only applies the stack size line — the status code fix must be preserved manually. | BUG-078 / LESSON-OPS-103 |
| 44 | Never use Arduino `String` (capital S) or bare `string` in ESP-IDF code. Always use `std::string`. The coding agent's CI does not perform ESP-IDF compilation — Arduino-isms pass CI but break the real build. Treat `String` in agent-generated code as a PR review red flag. | BUG-077 / LESSON-OPS-104 |
| 45 | DOM references captured before an async auth flow (`requestManagementCredentials()`) become stale if `pollAggregatorLive()` fires during the wait and rebuilds `innerHTML`. Always re-query stable `id` nodes AFTER async boundaries. Suppress poll-driven rerenders while any action flag is true or while a management input has focus. | BUG-080/081 / LESSON-OPS-111 |
| 46 | Mock server response shapes must be verified against the live firmware `httpd_resp_sendstr()` call — not the prompt description, not an audit table, not a prior session summary. The firmware contract is the single source of truth. | LESSON-OPS-112 |

## Prompt File Naming Convention

Each step has exactly one prompt file:

```
prompts/<phase>/<version>-implementation-instructions-for-coding-agent.md

## Maintaining This Document

After each step completes:

1. Update the Step Index: change the completed step to `✅ Complete` with date
2. If the step revealed new critical rules, add them to the Critical Rules table
3. If the step required prompt changes to subsequent steps, note those changes and update the affected files (see `Docs/writing-prompts-for-coding-agents-guide.md` Section 11 for the audit methodology)
4. Verify the session log was created by the agent — if missing, create it manually before moving to the next step

### 2026-03-21 — Post-Phase-4 Review Revision

**Context:** Comprehensive post-Phase-4 review identified 5 bugs (BUG-052 through BUG-056) and multiple prompt quality gaps. Four independent third-party analyses (GP, GE, Codex, SO) reviewed the Phase 4 prompt set and implementation quality.

| Change | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **Phase 5 prompts revised (all 6 files)** | SO analysis identified 18 gaps. Critical fixes: CI-exact pre-conditions, FreeRTOS mutex for shared cache, pointer lifetime clarification, `_aggregatorReady` signal, MANDATORY existing-test audit, `waitForAggregatorReady()` helper, URL collision check, preflight updates, mock server 404, Closure Gate. |
| **Phase 6 prompts created (5 new files)** | Created from scratch incorporating all Phase 4 lessons: endpoint audit checklist, `chartIdx` verification, `NUM_SENSORS` protection, test group guardrails, MANDATORY fixture audit, CI matrix instructions. |
| **Phase 7 prompts updated (3 files)** | CI-exact pre-conditions, session log mandate, Instruction Compliance Output. 8 remaining prompts to be created when implementation begins. |
| **Writing guide updated (1115 lines)** | 3 new gap categories (11-13), Section 13 with 5 case studies, expanded Appendix B. |
| **Session log mandate added to ALL prompts** | Phase 4 produced zero session logs. Now a MANDATORY deliverable in every prompt. |
| **Instruction Compliance Output added to ALL prompts** | Prevents PR-057 class deviation where agents implement differently than specified. |
| **Validation Evidence added to test-step prompts** | Exact command + pass/fail/skip counts required as proof of CI-exact execution. |
| **Step Index expanded** | v7.5.4.5, Phase 6, expanded Phase 7 with "prompt not yet created" status. |
| **Critical Rules expanded (15→21)** | Rules 15-21 from LESSON-OPS-064/065/066, BUG-051/056, and review findings. |
| **Workflow updated** | Agent deliverables now include session log, compliance output, validation evidence. |

### 2026-03-18 — Initial Version

Created to replace three overlapping prompt management documents. Consolidated Phase 3, Phase 4, and Phase 5 step indices into a single workflow document.
